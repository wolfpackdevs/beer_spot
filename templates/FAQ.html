	<h5>Q: How does the website make recomendations? </h5>
	<p> A:
		 this website uses a very loose system at the moment based on keywords that the brewers use to describe their beers. If you like a beer with a keyword (e.g. roasty-malt) the system looks for a beer with the same
		keyword to give a recomendation
